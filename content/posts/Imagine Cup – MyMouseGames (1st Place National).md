**Our Entry**

The theme of the Imagine Cup in 2009 was the 10 world goals of the UN, mostly helping developing countries. Therefore, we chose to focus on education and to build it in **Silverlight** and **ASP.NET**. Essentially, our entry was composed of several mini educational games that allow you to have multiple mice on one computer to play. The idea is that one computer can work for many students. In addition, the teachers can change the lesson data that is being used in each game. On top of that, this can be functioned completely through a simple web site. The purpose was to help every student have access to a computer in ill funded schools.
